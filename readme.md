# Developer Analytics Dashboard

This project is designed to provide developers with insights into their API usage through a responsive dashboard. The project utilizes Flask for the backend APIs, React/JavaScript for the frontend, and MongoDB as the database. The choice of MongoDB allows for flexibility in the log schema, accommodating variable document structures.
